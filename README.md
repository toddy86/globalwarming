# Global Warming Project
The objective of this project is to create an interactive dashboard which provides information about how global warming is affecting individual cities around the globe. It is hoped that if people are able to see the impact which global warming is having on the city in which they live, that they will be more inclined to take action and help prevent further damage to the globe.

## Data Source
The data are obtained from the National Centers for Environmental Information, who hosts and provides public access to one of the most significant archives for environmental data on Earth. 

The data being used is the Global Surface Summary of the Day ("GSOD") dataset, which provides daily weather records from 1929 to present day, although the data from 1973 onwards is considered the most complete.
